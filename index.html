<p>Providinng you with the best beans for your coffee </p>
<p></br>What is light roasted beans?</br></br>Light Roast coffees are characterized by 
their light brown color, lack of oil on the beans, 
and light body (or viscosity). These beans are allowed to reach a temperature 
of about 350º–400º. When roasting, beans typically pop at around 350º. 
This popping sound—known as the “first crack”—serves as the cue that the beans have reached a Light Roast.</br></br>CLICK ON THE IMAGE TO SEE OUR LIGHT ROASTED BEANS PRODUCTS</p>

<p>What is medium roasted beans?</br></br>Medium Roast coffees are brown and have a little thicker body than a Light Roast. Unlike Light, Medium starts to take on a bit of the taste from the roasting process, losing some of the bright floral flavors that are typical of a Light Roast. Instead, they carry much more of a balanced flavor with a medium amount of caffeine. A Medium is roasted until just before the second crack, usually at about 410º–430º. Other roasters refer to a Medium as American Roast, Breakfast Roast, or City Roast. Our most popular Medium Roasts include Stargazer, Hawaiian Hazelnut, Southern Pecan, Papua New Guinea, and Costa Rican.</p>

</br></br></br></br><p>What is dark roasted beans?</br></br>Dark Roast coffees are dark brown, even close to a blackened color. The beans are characterized by drawn-out oil that glosses the surface. Coffee made from a Dark Roast has a robust, full body. The flavors from the coffee’s country of origin are almost entirely roasted out, taking on a very bold and smoky taste.Dark beans roast to a temperature of anything higher than 440º or essentially the end of the second crack.</p>
